**The k-means clustering algorithm is known to be efficient in clustering large data sets. It is one of the simplest and the best known unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well-known clustering problem. The K-Means algorithm aims to partition a set of objects, based on their attributes/features, into k clusters, where k is a predefined or user-defined constant.**

## Overview

   **In this project we will cluster news articles into different categories automatically using unsupervised machine learning algorithm which is KMeans. The dataset consists of 4130 news articles in diffrent categories like business, entertainment, politics, sport, ect.**
